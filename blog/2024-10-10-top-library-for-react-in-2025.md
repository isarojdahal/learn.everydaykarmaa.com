Over the time new libraries and frameworks are evolving in the market. And, if you don't keep up with the pace, you will be left behind. I have been working with React for more than 5 years now. And, I have seen the evolution of React from class-based components to functional components.

When it comes to development with Reactjs, I have been using certain libraries such as Formik, yup, axios, and soon. But these tools and libraries that I have been using are kind of old now and the newer one is so appealing to use; as the newer one has solved the older libraries problems and has their own great features. For boosting my productivity and flexibility I re-learned most of the libraries and implemented.

**So, here is list of the tools changed in just span of 7 to 12 months.**

CRA -> Vite<br/>
Chakra/Material -> Shadcn/ Tailwind <br/>
Formik/Custom -> React Hook Form<br/>
Yup -> Zod/Class Validator<br/>
React Router Dom -> TanStack Router<br/>
Table -> TanStack Table<br/>
Custom Axios -> TanStack Query<br/>
Custom Context -> TanStack Context (builtin of Tanstack Router)<br/>
Custom made Axios/Request/Response Type -> Generated Swagger Types (for TanStack router)<br/>
Custom Scripts -> Husky (pre-commit, post-commit, pre-push, and other)<br/>
Lengthy imports -> Vite-tsconfig-paths (alias based imports)<br/>
