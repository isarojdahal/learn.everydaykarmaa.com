I have founded <a href="https://28softwares.com"> 28Softwares</a>, a Software company, 10 months back. And, Intially I was not very concious about finances that I must invest on tools and services.

Just by name (that I have heared from Ads) I was using the product/service. And was upgrading to their service only as I was growing. But, I was not aware that I was spending more than I should have.
But as the time went by, I began to saw same quality/better quality of products with so minimal in prices.
And, I began to switch.

1. DigitalOcean -> [Contabo](https://contabo.com) (For VPS) : I have been using DigitalOcean for 3 years now. But never realized that there was a better option. I just went to it; and upgraded the droplet size as per my new requirements. But later this year, I found Contabo. And, I was amazed by its pricing. I could get same specs with less pricing. (Same specs with less pricing. **In DO, I used to have 28$ Droplet (server), which had around 28\*12 = $336 yearly cost; In Contabo, I have same specs with 6$, making it $72 per year).** And talking about big clouds companies such as AWS, I love them, but I dont recommend for startups. Yes you can get 5K dollar AWS Credit for small startups but that wont suffice over the time and eventually you will get into AWS billing cycle.

2. Jira/Trello/Notion -> [Linear](https://linear.app)
   (Notion's block storage gets full after 1/2 projects; Trello has 10 boards on its free version, and, Jira is 1 month free; Whereas Linear is kind of free for most of the things.and beautiful part about Linear is its keyboard navigation feature)

3. Slack -> [Discord](https://discord.com)
   Slack has its after 3 months chat removal thing. I feel Its very professional for startups. Whereas Discord has its own easyness, configuration part (roles, privileges), flexiblity and unlimited audio and video calls.

4. ABC Email Service -> [Zoho](https://zoho.com) Email Services.
   In any ABC email services, it always has certain fee for their email services. If you are tech person, One thing you can do, is to setup your own email server on your VPS. But on free version, you can start with Zoho email services for 5 accounts being free.

5. DBDiagrams/Docs -> [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) (ProjectDocumentation) :
   Previously the project documents , diagrams and other importants thing were stored here and there in different places, which was hard to find and manage. But as I started to use Docusaurus for project documentation (either be it storing env variables) or for App Diagrams / Workflow diagrams, I found it very easy to manage. You just go to that docusaurus doc and get all the information in one place.

6. Godaddy -> [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com) (Domain Registration)
   Godaddy has been the most popular domain registration service. But, I found Porkbun to be more cheaper and reliable.

7. Facebook/Instagram/X -> [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com) (Digital Marketing)
   For different product niche different social media platform is good and are recommended accordingly. (For goods: Facebook/Instagram, For courses: Coursera,X, etc) But for software product as like ours, LinkedIn has been the best marketing platform as it not connect us from company to company but also with potential Business person and investors.
