1. Make Readme Descriptive
   I have always thought that Readme is just a file that contains the description of the project. But, it is more than that. It is the first thing that a user sees when they visit your repository. So, it is important to make it descriptive.

2. Need to make board if and only if project goes large and needs active core-maintiners.

3. Dublicate PRs on same issue.
   Label who is assigned to that work.

4. Engagment in all of the issues.
   If you are working on one part of project , your involvement on other issues is also important. It helps to understand the project better. and helps to identify the doing changes better.

5. Uses of Badges (for easier workings)
