title: Introduction to System Design
---

To first really understand the system design, we first need to understand system component itself such as Database, Caching, Server, Networks, and soon.

Also with that, there comes lots of jargons such as Scaling, Copuling, Avaibility, and soon.


To Note: In system design, we mostly talk about the backend stuff; however, it's also important to understand the frontend stuff as well.
